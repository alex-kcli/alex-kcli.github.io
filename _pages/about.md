Kangcheng is a graduate student at Northwestern University with major in Computer Science. Before that, he graduated from UCLA with a bachelor degree in Linguistics and Computer Science. He loves doing projects with a Wow factor, taking time understanding design concepts, and talking about code. He is most interested in the development of applications that bring values to people's lives.

When Kangcheng's not working, you can find him binge watching netfilx series, going out in nature, taking a stoll around the shoreline, attending concerts, or participating northwestern university events.

At the moment, Kangcheng is looking for an internship / full-time position as a Software Engineer.
